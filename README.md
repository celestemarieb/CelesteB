Welcome reader,

My name is Celeste and I'm a new developer and experienced Product Manager from Australia

I have previously contributed to fintech startups in Sydney, spread joy serving at a waffle cart in Melbourne and operated heavy machinery in rural Victoria. 

###### education 

Alongside self-study, I'm currently working towards a diploma in information technology at Coder Academy

I have a history degree and a Juris Doctor of Law from the University of Melbourne.

I like to say I'm thorough about taking in the full picture - I started with understanding the past, so I could work out what's possible in the present and now I'm loving building the future

###### experience

###### interests 

I'm interested in great Australian movies and restoring our planet.

In particular, I would like to work on green engineering projects or applications designed to arrest the progress of climate change.

I also, usually, would quite like to know what's for dinner.
